# E-Shoppe

This project is a front-end solution for displaying a product catalog. The catalog fetches product data from a public API and presents it with a responsive design that adjusts for both desktop and mobile views. It includes a live search feature to filter products in real-time, providing a seamless user experience.

The application is built using Vite for fast development, TypeScript for type safety, React for the user interface, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and utility-first styling. The app also integrates state management with Redux Toolkit to handle product data and search state efficiently. Additionally, it supports dark, light, and system-based themes, allowing users to switch between theme modes based on their preferences or system settings.
